Aim - There is an array a, we have to make another array b from the given array a of same size from 1 to n such that b[i]contains the product of elements of a[i] but not the element present that index.

Algorith - 
1) Make an array a of size n .
2) Make another array b of size n and have values zero .
3) Multiply all the elements of array a , say we get m after multiply.
4) Now divide the answer m with the elements of a at that index and the final answers are elements of array b.
