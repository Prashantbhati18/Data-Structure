Aim - Number of bounces by the ball when the ball falling from a height through a given velocity.
Algorithm - 
1) Firstly get the value of velocity by user .
2) Now run a while loop since the velocity becomes zero .
3) In while loop count the number of bounces by the ball.

Output - Print the value of number of bounces.
